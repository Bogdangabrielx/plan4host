-- plan4host â€” RPC: account_delete_property_hard(p_property_id uuid)
-- Purpose: Delete a property and all dependent data explicitly (hard delete),
--          without relying on ON DELETE CASCADE, while still honoring RLS.
-- Notes:
--  - SECURITY INVOKER: caller must have RLS permissions to delete each row.
--    Admin (and editor with proper scopes) should pass; viewer will be blocked.
--  - If some tables are missing in a given environment, guarded EXECUTE blocks ignore them.
